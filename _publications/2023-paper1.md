      Many shared resources, such as **hotel rooms** or **rental cars**, require **cleaning**, **charging**, or some other operation to turn around the resources between successive customer uses. We study **staffing** and **shift planning** decisions for the turnaround service capacity to minimize the sum of **customer waiting** and **staffing costs**. **Random customer departures**, **random arrivals**, and **worker shifts with breaks** add to the managerial challenge. Using the frameworks of **diminishing returns**, **submodularity**, and **M-convexity**, we demonstrate analytical properties for capacity decisions in three staffing scenarios, including our primary model that focuses on **shift planning**. We propose a **solution heuristic** that efficiently provides near-optimal solutions. 

      Using data from a large city-center hotel, we illustrate the value of our model for **hotel housekeeping operations**:
      - **Flexible shift start times**, especially later in the day, can **eliminate guest waiting** after check-in.
      - Departing from the industry-standard 8:00 am start reduces **room attendant idleness** and **room readiness issues**.
      - **Two shift start times** in the morning virtually eliminate waiting and support **worker recruitment** and **retention**.
