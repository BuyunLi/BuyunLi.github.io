    During outbreaks of infectious diseases, hospitals encounter significant challenges in making well-informed nurse staffing decisions. The dilemma during these outbreaks involves a simultaneous increase in inpatient admissions during disease outbreaks and a notably elevated rate of nurse absenteeism caused by infections. The unobservable nature of nurse infection time, incubation period, and number of nurses infected but yet to show symptoms adds complexity to understanding when and how nurses are infected. Lack of this critical information restricts hospital managers from implementing effective and informed operational strategies and staffing plans, limiting their ability to proactively address the staffing crisis during an outbreak. We develop a dynamic random graph model with hidden nurse health status to examine the interplay between staffing policies and infection transmission dynamics. Our model extends existing random graph frameworks by incorporating nurse health status (healthy, incubation, symptomatic) as a latent variable that is endogenously linked to the evolution of disease transmission networks. Within this framework, we design an estimation procedure that maps nurse characteristics to disease transmission rates across patient-to-nurse, nurse-to-nurse, and community-to-nurse interactions. This approach enables dynamic tracking of infection sources, locations, and timing. Using data from the IU-Health hospital system during the COVID-19 pandemic, we perform counterfactual analyses to assess the effectiveness of mitigation and staffing policies aimed at protecting nurses from infections. We find that hospitals can reduce nurse absenteeism due to infection by up to 25% through improved staffing levels and workload management. Furthermore, when establishing dedicated units for the care of infectious patients, simply isolating infected patients is insufficient; it is crucial to assign a fixed group of nurses exclusively to these patients to minimize cross-infection.
