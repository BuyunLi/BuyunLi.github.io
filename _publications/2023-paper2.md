    In many service industries, decision making about service scheduling often relies on assessing and prioritizing customer needs and value using professional judgment and customer data. Traditional scheduling models assume perfect knowledge of customer service rewards and delay costs, which is unrealistic. This paper considers the optimal scheduling problem in a multi-class queueing system where the system manager learns the reward of serving customers dynamically. We model the scheduling problem as a restless multiarmed bandit (RMAB) problem, with each customer class representing an arm characterized by queue length and the manager's belief about the reward distribution. We derive the Whittle index for each customer class. The resulting Whittle index scheduling policy which prioritizes the class of customers with the highest Whittle index. We prove that the Whittle index offers an optimal solution for a system with two customer classes-one with perfect information and one with unknown parameters-and show that it is near-optimal for more general settings numerically. Our results show that the incentive to serve a class of customers with unknown rewards increases with service rate, higher belief in rewards, arrival rate and length of wait, which contrasts with traditional models. This finding highlights that as queues grow longer, the priority for serving them increases due to extended busy periods. Furthermore, for a fixed product of service rate and reward, we find that customer classes with higher service rates provides higher incentives for learning. By understanding these dynamics, managers can better allocate resources, ensuring that longer queues, which imply greater potential delays and customer dissatisfaction, are addressed more promptly.
