abstract: "Chronic pain, affecting approximately 25% of U.S. adults and costing $560–$635 billion annually, poses significant challenges to healthcare systems due to high utilization and fragmented care. This study investigates whether early referral to pain management specialists enhances treatment effectiveness and reduces unnecessary surgical interventions for chronic pain patients. Utilizing national insurance claim data from 140,000 patients and 35 million claims, we employ a difference-in-differences framework and a two-stage regression approach, leveraging a 2016–2022 zero-copay policy for physical therapy/chiropractic visits in the South Atlantic division as an external shock. Results indicate a 56.5% increase in the odds of early pain management intervention, leading to significant reductions in healthcare costs, outpatient visits, and a 12.0% decrease in unnecessary surgeries, alongside a 7.7% reduction in post-surgical visits and costs. Despite these benefits, the limited capacity of pain management specialists (3,500 nationwide versus 75 million patients) highlights access bottlenecks. Ongoing research explores optimal allocation strategies for pain specialists to maximize clinical and operational outcomes under capacity constraints."
