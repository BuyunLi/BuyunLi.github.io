    Chronic pain is an increasing public health concern that affects an estimated 50 million adults in the United States each year and contributes to substantial healthcare costs and lost productivity. We examine whether early intervention by pain management specialists can reduce surgeries and costs. Leveraging a 2019 pilot program by insurers that eliminated copays and deductibles for three physical therapy sessions for low back pain patients across five states, we implement a novel two-stage model that employs a difference-in-differences (DiD) estimate as an instrumental variable (IV). The first stage estimates the exogenous change in the likelihood of patients receiving early pain management intervention in a DiD framework. The second stage uses the change as an IV for early pain management intervention. We find that early intervention significantly reduces healthcare utilization, costs, surgeries, and opioid reliance for patients with new-onset chronic pain. We validated our findings using insurance claims from a chronic-pain specialist network in Southern California. Our work provides large-scale causal evidence of the value of strategically shifting PM consultation in the care trajectory and underscores the critical need for providers, payers, and policymakers to restructure referral pathways and benefit designs to prioritize timely pain management specialist access.
