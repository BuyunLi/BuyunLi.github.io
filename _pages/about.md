I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Operations and Decision Technologies at the [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu/). Before joining Kelley, I earned a Master of Science from the [S.C. Johnson College of Business](https://business.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University and a Bachelor of Science in Business and Economics from the  [Univeristy of Queensland](https://bel.uq.edu.au/).

 My research focuses on developing data-driven, optimization-based scheduling applications to enhance the efficiency, resilience, and effectiveness of healthcare operation systems. My work integrates dynamic scheduling, Bayesian learning, and stochastic modeling to address complex operational challenges, such as infection-aware nurse staffing and early intervention strategies for chronic pain management. By combining analytical modeling with empirical insights, I aim to improve decision-making processes that optimize resource allocation and patient outcomes.
