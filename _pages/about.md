I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Operations and Decision Technologies at the [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu/). Before joining Kelley, I earned a Master of Science from the [S.C. Johnson College of Business](https://business.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University and a Bachelor of Science in Business and Economics from the  [University of Queensland](https://bel.uq.edu.au/).

 My research focuses on <b>healthcare operations</b>, examining how the dynamic interplay between provider capacity and patient demand creates self-reinforcing interdependencies in care delivery. My research centers on two core areas: <em><u>Pain Operations Management</u></em>, where I use large-scale data to evaluate the benefits of early pain management interventions and design referral policies that prioritize patients who gain the most from scarce specialist appointments; and <u><em>Infection Aware Nurse Staffing</em></u>, where I model how staffing decisions interact with disease transmission to mitigate infection-driven absenteeism and build workforce resilience during outbreaks. Together, these projects aim to break vicious feedback loops in healthcare delivery, improve system performance, and enhance patient outcomes. 
 
Beyond healthcare applications, I also develop <u><em>technical models and methodologies for service operations</em></u>, with a particular interest in embedding learning into service systems. My work examines how information revealed during service—such as patient characteristics—can be incorporated into scheduling and capacity decisions
